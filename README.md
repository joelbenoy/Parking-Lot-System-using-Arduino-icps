# Smart Parking Lot System Using IR Sensor and Arduino

Project Title: Smart Parking Lot System Using IR Sensor and Arduino

Description:

This project presents a Smart Parking Lot System designed using an IR sensor and Arduino Nano to automate vehicle detection and parking slot availability. The system utilizes infrared (IR) sensors to detect the presence of vehicle at entry or exit way allowing real-time monitoring of parking space availability.

The system then displays this information on a 16x2 LCD display with I2C module via I2C protocol.

The core functionality revolves around detecting changes in the IR sensor's digital output and interpreting those changes to update the parking slot status. This automation reduces the need for manual monitoring and can be used to build scalable smart parking infrastructure in malls, offices, or smart cities.

This prototype is a foundational model for modern IoT-enabled parking systems, offering efficient space usage, reduced traffic congestion, and enhanced user convenience.
